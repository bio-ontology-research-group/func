func_mtc -- reads a tab-separated-values file, calculates FDR, FWER 
            and global-p and prints the tsv-file 3 additional columns for the
	    calculated values.

Please Note
===========

func_mtc uses the (data and randomset) p-values for calculating 
the FDR, FWER and the global p. All other columns must be present,
but are not used. This means i.e. that func_mtc will not treat the taxonomies 
separately. There is only one global-p value per file calculated.


Input Format
============

The input file should contain the following fields:
1) GO_ID
2) taxonomy
3) description
4) nr genes in root node
5) nr genes in this go node
6) data pval
7-N) randomset pvals

The inputfile must contain a headerline with the same
amount of columns as the rest of the inputfile.

Output Format
=============

func_mtc will print the inputfile and attaches 3 more
columns:

N+1) FWER
N+2) FDR
N+3) global p
