                        INSTALLING FUNC

This file describes how to install FUNC under GNU/Linux (or UNIX). 



1. REQUIREMENTS

In order to compile and install FUNC you will need the standalone 
R-Math Library. If you are lucky and have a Debian GNU/Linux, you
can type

        apt-get install r-mathlib 

to install the library. Otherwise you may have to compile it yourself. 
Get the source from http://www.r-project.org/. After you unpacked the
R-Source look at the README in src/nmath/standalone for instructions on
how to compile the standalone library.

Otherwise, you will only need some common programs (like bash, sed,
grep, make, perl) and of course an C++ compiler.



2. EASY INSTALLATION

Change to the src directory with 

        cd src/

and run

        ./configure
        make
        make install

If nothing goes wrong, all programs will be installed to
/usr/local/bin. Check the documentation in /usr/local/doc or 
run 

        man func

for basic instructions about the programs.



3. INSTALLATION

If you installed the R standalone mathlib to some unusual place 
you probably want to set LDFLAGS to compile FUNC

        LDFLAGS=-L/home/pruefer/lib ./configure

You may want to add a --prefix=/path/ to install FUNC to another
directory. Run ./configure --help for more options. Don't forget
to include the path to the R standalone lib to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Then proceed with

        make
        make install

Read the documentation and have fun.
